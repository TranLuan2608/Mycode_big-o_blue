     * There are N countries 1,2,3,4....N and Nâˆ’1 roads(i.e depicting a tree)
     *
     * Bishu lives in the Country 1 so this can be considered as the root of the tree.
     *
     * Now there are Q girls who lives in various countries (not equal to 1) .
     *
     * All of them want to propose Bishu. But Bishu has some condition.
     *
     * He will accept the proposal of the girl who lives at minimum distance from his country.
     *
     * Now the distance between two countries is the number of roads between them.
     *
     * If two or more girls are at the same minimum distance then he will accept the proposal of the
     * girl who lives in a country with minimum id.
     *
     * No two girls are at same country.
     * Print the idid of the country of the girl who will be accepted.
