     * Petya and Vasya are brothers. Today is a special day for them as their parents left them
     * home alone and commissioned them to do n chores. Each chore is characterized by a single
     * parameter â€” its complexity. The complexity of the i -th chore equals H_i
     * As Petya is older, he wants to take the chores with complexity larger than some value x (h_i>x)
     * to leave to Vasya the chores with complexity less than or equal to  x(h_i <= x)
     * The brothers have already decided that Petya will do exactly a chores and Vasya will do exactly b chores (a + b = n)
     * In how many ways can they choose an integer x so that Petya got exactly a chores and Vasya got exactly b chores?
