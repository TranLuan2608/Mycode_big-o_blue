    /**
     * Before bridges were common, ferries were used to transport cars across rivers. River ferries,
     * unlike their larger cousins, run on a guide line and are powered by the riverâ€™s current.
     * Cars drive onto the ferry from one end, the ferry crosses the river, and the cars exit
     * from the other end of the ferry.
     *
     * There is a ferry across the river that can take N cars across the river in T minutes and
     * return in T minutes. A car may arrive at either river bank to be transported by the ferry
     * to the opposite bank. The ferry travels continuously back and forth between the banks so
     * long it is carrying a car or there is at least one car waiting at either bank. Whenever
     * the ferry arrives at one of the banks, it unloads its cargo and loads up to N cars that
     * are waiting to cross. If there are more than N, those that have been waiting the longest
     * are loaded. If there are no cars waiting on either bank, the ferry waits until one arrives,
     * loads it (if it arrives on the same bank of the ferry), and crosses the river. At what time
     * does each car reach the other side of the river?
