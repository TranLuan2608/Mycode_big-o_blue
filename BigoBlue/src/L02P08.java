     * Alice and Bob like games. And now they are ready to start a new game.
     * They have placed n chocolate bars in a line. Alice starts to eat chocolate
     * bars one by one from left to right, and Bob â€” from right to left. For each
     * chocololate bar the time, needed for the player to consume it, is known
     * (Alice and Bob eat them with equal speed). When the player consumes a chocolate bar,
     * he immediately starts with another. It is not allowed to eat two chocolate bars at
     * the same time, to leave the bar unfinished and to make pauses. If both players start
     * to eat the same bar simultaneously, Bob leaves it to Alice as a true gentleman.
     * How many bars each of the players will consume?
