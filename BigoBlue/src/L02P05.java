    /**
     * Sereja and Dima play a game. The rules of the game are very simple. The players haveâ€¯n
     * cards in a row. Each card contains a number, all numbers on the cards are distinct.
     * The players take turns, Sereja moves first. During his turn a player can take one card:
     * either the leftmost card in a row, or the rightmost one. The game ends when there is no
     * more cards. The player who has the maximum sum of numbers on his cards by the end of the game, wins.
     *
     * Sereja and Dima are being greedy. Each of them chooses the card with the larger number during his move.
     *
     * Inna is a friend of Sereja and Dima. She knows which strategy the guys are using, so she wants
     * to determine the final score, given the initial state of the game. Help her.
