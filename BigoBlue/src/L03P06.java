     * Little Vasya has received a young builderâ€™s kit. The kit consists of several wooden bars,
     * the lengths of all of them are known. The bars can be put one on the top of the other if their lengths are the same.
     *
     * Vasya wants to construct the minimal number of towers from the bars. Help Vasya to use the
     * bars in the best way possible.
