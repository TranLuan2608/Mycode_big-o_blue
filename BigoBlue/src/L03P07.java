     * What joy! Petya's parents went on a business trip for the whole year and the playful kid is
     * left all by himself. Petya got absolutely happy. He jumped on the bed and threw pillows all
     * day long, until..
     *
     * Today Petya opened the cupboard and found a scary note there. His parents had left him with
     * duties: he should water their favourite flower all year, each day, in the morning, in the
     * afternoon and in the evening. "Wait a second!" â€” thought Petya. He know for a fact that if
     * he fulfills the parents' task in the i-th (1<=i<=12)  month of the year, then the flower will grow by a_i
     * centimeters, and if he doesn't water the flower in the i-th month, then the flower won't grow this month.
     * Petya also knows that try as he might, his parents won't believe that he has been watering the
     * flower if it grows strictly less than by k centimeters.
     * Help Petya choose the minimum number of months when he will water the flower, given that the
     * flower should grow no less than by k centimeters.
