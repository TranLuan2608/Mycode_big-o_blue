    /**
     *
     * A new web-design studio, called SMART (Simply Masters of ART), employs two people. The first
     * one is a web-designer and an executive director at the same time. The second one is a programmer.
     * The director is so a nimble guy that the studio has already got N contracts for web site development.
     * Each contract has a deadline d_i
     *
     * It is known that the programmer is lazy. Usually he does not work as fast as he could.
     * Therefore, under normal conditions the programmer needs b_i of time to perform the contract
     * number i. Fortunately, the guy is very greedy for money. If the director pays him x_i
     * dollars extra, he needs only (b_i - a_i * x_i) of time to do his job. But this extra payment does not
     * influence other contracts. This means that each contract should be paid separately to be
     * done faster. The programmer is so greedy that he can do his job almost instantly if the extra
     * payment is (b_i/a_i)dollars for the contract number i.
     * The director has a difficult problem to solve. He needs to organize programmerâ€™s job and,
     * may be, assign extra payments for some of the contracts so that all contracts are performed
     * in time. Obviously he wishes to minimize the sum of extra payments. Help the director!
     *
     * For each testcase in the input your program should output one line with a single real number S.
     * Here S is the minimum sum of money which the director needs to pay extra so that the programmer
     * could perform all contracts in time. The number must have two digits after the decimal point.
     *
     * Ex
     *  input
     *  1
     *  2
     *  20 50 100
     *  10 100 50
     *  output
     *  5.00
