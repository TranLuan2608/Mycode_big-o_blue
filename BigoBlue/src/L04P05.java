     * A molecule can be defined as a sequence of atoms and represented by a chemical formula
     * consisting of letters denoting these atoms. E.g. letter H denotes atom of hydrogen,
     * C denotes atom of carbon, O denotes atom of oxygen, formula COOH represents molecule
     * consisting of one atom of carbon, two atoms of oxygen and one atom of hydrogen.
     *
     * To write some formulas efficiently, we use the following rules. Letters denoting some
     * atoms can be grouped by enclosing in parentheses, e.g. formula CH(OH) contains group
     * OH. Groups can be nested â€“ a group can also contain other groups. To simplify a formula,
     * consecutive occurrences of the same letter can be replaced with that letter followed by a
     * number of these occurrences. E.g. formula COOHHH can be written as CO22H33 and it represents
     * a molecule consisting of one atom of carbon, two atoms of oxygen and three atoms of hydrogen.
     * Furthermore, consecutive occurrences of the same group can be replaced with that group followed
     * by a number of these occurrences. E.g. formula CH(CO2H) (CO2H) (CO2H) can be written
     * as CH(CO2H)3 and molecule represented by both those formulas consists of four atoms
     * of carbon, four atoms of hydrogen and six atoms of oxygen. A number written after a letter
     * or a group is always greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 9. A mass of a
     * molecule is a sum of masses of all its atoms. One atom of hydrogen has mass 1, one atom of
     * carbon has mass 12 and one atom of oxygen has mass  16.
     * Write a program that will calculate a mass of a molecule.
