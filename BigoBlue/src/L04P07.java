     *
     * In this problem you have to simulate the workflow of one-thread server.
     * There are nn queries to process, the i-th will be received at moment _i
     * and needs to be processed for d_i units of time. All t_i  are guaranteed to be distinct.
     * When a query appears server may react in three possible ways:
     * If server is free and query queue is empty, then server immediately starts to process this query.
     * If server is busy and there are less than b queries in the queue, then new query is added to the end of the queue.
     * If server is busy and there are already b queries pending in the queue, then new query is just rejected and will never be processed
     * As soon as server finished to process some query, it picks new one from the queue
     * (if it's not empty, of course). If a new query comes at some moment x, and the server
     * finishes to process another query at exactly the same moment, we consider that first
     * query is picked from the queue and only then new query appears.
     *
     * For each query find the moment when the server will finish to process it or print âˆ’1 if this query will be rejected.
     * Ex1
     *  input
     *  5 1
